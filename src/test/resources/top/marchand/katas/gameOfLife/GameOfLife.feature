Feature: Game of Life

  This Kata is about calculating the next generation of Conwayâ€™s game of life,
  given any starting position. See
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
  for background.

  You start with a two dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either alive
  or dead. In this version of the problem, the grid is finite, and no life can exist
  off the edges. When calculating the next generation of the grid, follow these rules:

  1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
  2) Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.
  3) Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
  4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.

  Scenario Outline: calculate next generation with 0 or 1 neighbor
    Given grid is <source>
    When calculating next generation
    Then new grid is <target>
    Examples:
      | source        | target        |
      | "   /   /   " | "   /   /   " |
      | "X  /   /   " | "   /   /   " |
      | " X /   /   " | "   /   /   " |
      | "  X/   /   " | "   /   /   " |
      | "   /X  /   " | "   /   /   " |
      | "   /X  /   " | "   /   /   " |
      | "   /  X/   " | "   /   /   " |
      | "   /   /X  " | "   /   /   " |
      | "   /   / X " | "   /   /   " |
      | "   /   /  X" | "   /   /   " |

  Scenario Outline: calculate next generation with 2 neighbors
    Given grid is <source>
    When calculating next generation
    Then new grid is <target>
    Examples:
      | source        | target        |
      | " X /   / X " | "   /XXX/   " |
      | "X  / X /  X" | " X /XXX/ X " |
      | "  X/ X /X  " | " X /XXX/ X " |
      | "  X/   / X " | "   / XX/   " |
      | "  X/   /  X" | "   / XX/   " |
      | " X /   /X  " | "   /XX /   " |
      | " X /   /  X" | "   / XX/   " |
      | "X  /   /X  " | "   /XX /   " |
      | "X  /   / X " | "   /XX /   " |
